## Gatekeeping and toxicity

Gatekeeping is a form of toxicity.

In this paragraph I will talk mostly about gatekeeping, but the solutions also work with toxic people.

In this text I use "gatekeeper" - but you can read it as "toxic" or "manipulative."

All of these actually mean the same in IT.

## Intro

> **In advance** to HRs who saw this book in my CV and read it
>
> * If this part seems a "red flag" to you - you don't need me.
> * Before I'd say "I'm glad because I'd find a better company," but now I literally don't care.
>
> If your team consists of homos and enthusiasts - I'd love to join and make it and the company better.
>
> However, if it's a snake hole where everyone hates each other - have fun.

I understand that most of the readers will be intern-to-middle level, so I don't tell you to troll gatekeepers in return irl.

I mean the rules I provide below are not meant for you to "avoid gatekeepers" - they are the bare minimum to not lose self-respect.

---

## Why I include this

1. Yes, I have never been a junior developer, I began from the position of a middle developer.
2. Yes, I have never obeyed degenerates who criticize me, maybe this is why my views are non-standard. And whenever someone tried to criticize my code I demanded proofs right here, because "believe me bro" is not enough.
3. However, yes, I'm an emphatic person and I have **seen cases** when during the "code review" (mocking the newcomer) the senior was leaving comments like ***"What is this?"*** or ***"What the fuck is this supposed to do?"***

And to be honest, that piece of code wasn't bad at all. He had seen an insecure intern and even invited his friend, another senior, to have a call with that intern on Slack to explain what he wrote.

That said, this is clearly about your self-respect.

* Shitty companies won't believe and keep yapping ***"The feedback is not personal, it's not about you"*** - but when someone says ***"What the fuck is this supposed to do?"*** it's beyond any norms.

### Example. Answering to question "What the fuck is this supposed to do?"

* **First of all**, it's code. You won't believe, but it is. If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck. So it's a piece of code.
* **Second of all**, that code also passed all the CI tests. So who fucked up?

**Next**, go to HR and ask them to translate the question ***"What the fuck is this supposed to do?"*** from their company's corporate language to civil language. If the answer is not given - go to higher management. If nobody gives a satisfiable answer - leave.

## No really 

What is the problem to act as a professional and respect each other? Is it hard to provide constructive feedback? Is it hard to not turn your company into a shit-hole to avoid then make media content to show how good that company is.

I understand why, and I will mention later, however, anyway, having a healthy team is anyway cheaper and more productive.

## Seven rules on how to treat gatekeepers

At first, you may think gatekeepers are energy vampires or just mentally unstable. Doesn't matter. That is not your problem, and the company doesn't pay you to deal with that.

---

### Rule 1. Gatekeepers should not be taken seriously and ignored by default

There's no difference between a troll from the internet and a gatekeeper.

None of them want you to become better = you don't need to give a kite about anything they say. Even if it seems to change your life.

---

### Rule 2. Confidence ≠ competence

Being a gatekeeper doesn't mean being a "true professional."

Stop taking the self-posing and confidence of gatekeepers as "he is speaking confidently" => "he must be a professional."

Most of them just watched a YouTube video once and now pose like gurus.

---

### Rule 3. Don't fall for the manipulation "I want you to improve"

If they really wanted that - they would say it one-on-one, and in a civil and supportive way. At least respectfully?

**Spoiler**: No one but your family and friends don't give a shit about you. Sorry.

---

### Rule 4. Never talk to gatekeepers in private

Private conversations with a gatekeeper are a gift to their ego - they feel they gained some attention.
Plus it's a great time for a gatekeeper to troll you and nobody will know.
So, if you need to have a one-on-one - be short.

---

### Rule 5. Be careful and stay cold

Do not rush. They might be recording. So you can too.

---

### Rule 6. Do not return

This one is for the maximally naive.

If a gatekeeper helped you with some task, do not hurry to return the favor. This way they may help you once and then ask for returns constantly.

Feel free to say "I'm busy now."

* If they ask for time, say "30 mins, 1 hour." Once they come 30 mins later, say "2 hours" and so on.
* If they remind you that they have helped you, calmly answer "Thank you. In 30 mins I will finish," and return to previous tactics.

---

### Rule 7. Management

Do not hesitate to talk to HR, project manager, or even product manager.

In case of men, this is a hard thing to do. However, you cannot show his place in front of others and under cameras. See that your hands are tied?

> Personal experience: When I was younger, I used to think this would mean that I lost and came to someone "to complain."
> Later I understood one thing:
>
> * There are no rules at work. The friendliest bro sitting next to you may go and complain to management behind your back, because he wants your position. Now let's guess - will the toxic gatekeeper do it?

So fuck it. There's no such thing as "knight's dignity" in corporate culture.
And do not give a kite what the gatekeeper will label you - they will anyway.

## The point of gatekeepers

As gatekeepers, just like any other trolls, are not that smart, all of their manipulations come down to two tricks:

* **Blaming.** "Everyone but you," "No one but you" and so on. As I said, we don't take their words seriously, and reply in their style: **_"Everyone but you."_** Simple, effective.


* **Manipulation.**

    * Forget “truth born in argument.”
    * A conversation with a gatekeeper is not a seek for consensus. At least for the gatekeeper.
    * Their argument is to constantly switch topics, to confuse you.
    * Simple solution - whenever the gatekeeper tries to switch the topic, remind him it's outside the initial discussion.

        * Yes, you are not interested in discussing a new topic. You discuss the initial one and return to it.
        * After returning to the same point twice - state to others that you don't care about the gatekeeper, that the conversation is over to you, and state your initial point, where the gatekeeper was wrong and you were right.

## Why companies tolerate gatekeeping?

> #### Let's take a break and ask yourself. Why do companies not strangle such destructive behavior?

**Bingo! Companies leverage gatekeeping.** They use gatekeepers to:

* Make other employees do more work than they are responsible for.
* Artificially inflate the competency bar.

    * Example: a backend developer **must** also know front-end development, data engineering, DevOps, and even have some UX/UI skills.
      And even if you notice it is rather about slavery, some gatekeeper will pop up to tell you "You must know. Hah, you don't know."

Not all companies. Still it's 50/50. However, the 50% of companies do not strangle gatekeeping and toxicity, literally because **"You are a developer, you must know."**

**P.S.** I’m a developer. So please email me - should I take a short course in electrical engineering or not? Computers use electricity. “Must I know or not?” Just asking.
