# Pro Tip

A lifehack for companies **to unlock an infinite free labor pool**.

Step by step:
1. Post a job of a middle or a senior developer.
2. Once applicants sent their resumes, contact them:
   - Send them a _"test-case"_ that's needed to be done.
   - Mention two things:
     - The test-case is **_"Must-Implement"_** to proceed, otherwise they will be **rejected**.
     - The candidate **must use the exact technologies** specified in the test description. Using other technologies is **forbidden**.

### ü•≥ Congratulations

You just joined the **smartest companies** who leverage the market collapse and tap into the infinite free labor pool. Since now, there are no human-rights or jurisdiction for you because you'll be too busy cashing in to care.



- ‚úÖ This way you can melt the backlog through candidates, one ticket - one candidate.
- ‚úÖ Or the classic - candidates do the tasks without current assignees.

### üéÅ Bonus

No need for an actual job opening. Just use LinkedIn Premium (free trials work too). You can also register fake companies and do this. As well as on other platforms.
