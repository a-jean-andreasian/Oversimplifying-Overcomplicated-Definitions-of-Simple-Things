# Content Creators I recommend

_Note:_ I don't get any money from these recommendations, unfortunately. I respect the content they make want to share it with you.


---
## Entertainment


- [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen). `#Entertainment #Learning` 
  - **Fun**, **entertaining**, and elite content, full of dad-jokes, and a perfect **example of how a professional mindset and skills**. 
  - This guy codes more than lots of chest-puffing "seniors" and "course-sellers" live, however, he can humbly say "I don't know" or "I want to learn deeper" whereas having hands-on experience of years in it. It's a rare thing. 
  - I recommend starting from "[MAXIMUM CRINGE Programming Language Tier List | Prime Reacts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXHsPKPD_eo&t=5s)"  to understand the difference between a **_yapper (how to not be)_** and a **_professional developer (how to be)_**. 
    - By the way, that yapper is an opinion-leader and top-voice on LinkedIn, tho. _That's everything you need to know about LinkedIn._



- [Programmers are also human](https://www.youtube.com/@programmersarealsohuman5909/videos). `#Entertainment`
    - This guy is a legend. You should've heard these classics:
      - _"Am I learning from the AI, or the AI is learning from me"_
      - _"The bug isn't in my code, it's in the Intel architecture."_

      Yes, it's this guy. And if you haven't watched his videos, recommended to begin with [Next-door 10x engineer // PART 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yeb5gSLnjw) and [Interview with Senior Rust Developer](https://youtu.be/TGfQu0bQTKc?si=dl0NUY2vIpTNuy9A).


- [Socially Inept / Techroastshow](https://www.youtube.com/@techroastshow) `#Entertainment`
  - Three comedians roast founders, and it's awesome.
  - Begin with [Roasting Startup Founders for 13 Minutes Straight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4HCZ18aVBM).


- [PC Security Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@pcsecuritychannel) `#Learning #News`
  - A great channel about cybersecurity.

## Learning

- [NeuralNine](https://www.youtube.com/@NeuralNine) `#Learning`
  - Solid software engineer, as an engineer should be. 


- [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/@TechWithTim) `#Learning`
  - To me Tim was a great content creator, and his [course on Tensorflow](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/) on freeCodeCamp was huge. However, by the time he focused more on beginner-friendly content.
