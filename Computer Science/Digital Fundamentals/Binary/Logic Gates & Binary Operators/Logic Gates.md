# What are logic gates

Logic gates are fundamental building blocks of digital circuits, implementing basic logical functions that are essential for digital computing. They operate on binary inputs (0s and 1s) and produce a binary output based on specific logical rules.

## Correspondence with Binary Operators


The binary operators correspond directly to **logic gates** in digital electronics. Each gate takes binary inputs (0 or 1)
and produces a binary output based on a specific rule:

| Operator  | Logic Gate Name | Symbolic Logic | Description                           |                                  |                                                                              |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `&`       | **AND gate**    | A ∧ B          | Output is 1 only if both inputs are 1 |                                  |                                                                              |
| \`        | \`              | **OR gate**    | A ∨ B                                 | Output is 1 if either input is 1 |                                                                              |
| `^`       | **XOR gate**    | A ⊕ B          | Output is 1 if inputs are different   |                                  |                                                                              |
| `~`       | **NOT gate**    | ¬A             | Inverts the input: 0 → 1, 1 → 0       |                                  |                                                                              |
| `&&` / \` |                 | \`             | Not used in hardware as-is            | (Boolean logic)                  | These are short-circuit logical operators in programming, not physical gates |

### Important Distinction:

* In **programming**, `&&` and `||` are used for controlling logic flow (evaluating true/false expressions).
* In **hardware**, we only use bitwise operations, implemented as gates.

So, the bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`) directly correspond to real **logic gates** in hardware design.
