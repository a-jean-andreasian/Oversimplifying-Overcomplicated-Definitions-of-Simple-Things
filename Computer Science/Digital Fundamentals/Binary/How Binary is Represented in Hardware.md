## What are transistors?

The CPU is made up of billions of tiny electrical switches called **transistors**.

- Transistors form the **building blocks** of the CPU and are used for processing instructions, performing calculations, and controlling data flow.

- They also make up **memory circuits**, which store and retrieve data.

---
## The states of transistors, and how binary `1` and `0` are being produced:

Transistors can exist in one of two states:
- ON (binary `1`) → When electrical current flows through the transistor.
- OFF (binary `0`) → When no electrical current flows.

---
## How this works?

In short:  
- The **power supply** provides electricity.  
- The **clock signal and control logic** dictate when transistors switch.  
- The **logic gates and circuits** determine which transistors should be activated based on operations.  


---
## How This Works (In Detail)  

The **power source** (PSU or battery) supplies electrical energy to the CPU, enabling it to process data.  

- The **clock signal** (generated by an oscillator) synchronizes transistor switching, while the **control unit** directs signals that determine which transistors should activate.  
- Transistors are grouped into **logic gates** (AND, OR, NOT, etc.), which control how current flows and perform computations.  
- The CPU has **power rails** (e.g., VCC for high voltage and GND for zero voltage) that distribute electricity. A transistor’s **gate** receives a control signal, either allowing current to pass (`1`) or blocking it (`0`), encoding data in binary form.  

By rapidly switching transistors on and off in a coordinated manner, the CPU processes billions of instructions per second.
