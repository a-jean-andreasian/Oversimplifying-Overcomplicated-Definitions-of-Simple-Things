# Beats


### What are Beats?

- [Beats agents](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/beats) are [transport pipes](../../Data/Pipe/Types%20of%20Pipes/Transport%20Pipe.md). 
- They are lightweight agents that collect and ship data.
- **Optionally** they can do basic transformation (like adding metadata).

### Type

One to one.

### ðŸ¡† **Reason**

Beats agents are like small streams, **feeding data into _Kafka_ (the main river)**, or **directly
to _Logstash_ (the processing pipe)**.
