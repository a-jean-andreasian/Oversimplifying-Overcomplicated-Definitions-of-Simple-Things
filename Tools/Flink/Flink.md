# What is Flink?

Apache Flink (Real-Time Stream Processing) is a processing [pipe](../../Data/Pipe/Pipe.md). It streams and processes data (analyzes, aggregates, computes).

- **Flink** is like a processing **fiter** on the river, modifying the water flow.
- It doesnâ€™t just move data - it **processes and analyzes it in real-time**.
- Unlike [Logstash](../Logstash/Logstash.md), Flink works on **continuous data streams** (low latency).
