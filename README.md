## Self-introduction

Well, I don't want to talk much about myself, because I want you to focus on the content of the book, analyze it, think about it, ask "What if?". This is the way to master something.

By the way, this is the exact opposite of what the individuals I criticize do.

No matter who said something, an intern or the best ever developer - **we need to focus on the content**, proofs, but not the self-introduction of the person behind it.

Because **anyone can introduce themselves anyhow** they want, and if you don't focus on their points and think, you will be misled.

And ffs **stop thinking in grades**. Personally, I met so many "seniors" who struggled with the simplest things like to validate JWT or to not use direct comparison to avoid timing attacks, and so many "juniors" who built huge systems as pet projects.

## Introduction

This is my - Armen-Jean Andreasian's book. 

- It aims to demystify programming by providing clear, straightforward explanations of complex concepts, and reveal the illusion that programming is hard.

**For this book**, I’ve gathered my notes from university and mixed them with my personal experience. It covers almost everything in software development, from printing "Hello World" to system design.

- No to the Moon and back definitions written by non-ancient and non-Greek philosophers. I try to keep everything simple as they are: what it is, how it works, seasoned with real life analogies.

## The reasons why I wrote this book

1. **The pseudo-intellectual definitions** in programming, whereas the core behind them is pretty simple and banal. Come on, programming is not quantum or astro physics. It is just a set of rules and instructions from computers. So such definitions have no other impact but making learners lose time.
2. **The arrogance** of developers who want to be more than they are, so they take these banal concepts and act like "Do you know what is encapsulation? No? So come back when you will understand it, you intern."
3. **The industry of instructors, teachers, and coaches** who have never had any noticeable background or project but dare to monetize newcomers. They are not even aware of the basics, yet they teach others. If someone finds it ethical - I don't.

As a gesture, the book is absolutely free. Unlike those who profit off confusion, I make it available to everyone.
