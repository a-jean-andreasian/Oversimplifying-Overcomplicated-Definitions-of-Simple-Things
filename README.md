## Introduction

This is my - Armen-Jean Andreasian's book. 

- It aims to demystify programming by providing clear, straightforward explanations of complex concepts, and reveal the illusion that programming is hard.


**For this book**, I’ve gathered my notes from university and mixed them with my personal experience. It covers almost everything in software development, from printing "Hello World" to system design.

- No to the Moon and back definitions written by non-ancient and non-Greek philosophers. I try to keep everything simple as they are: what it is, how it works, seasoned with real life analogies.

## The reasons why I wrote this book

1. I never liked the pseudo-intellectual definitions in programming. They make programming look hard, whereas the core behind them is pretty simple and banal. However, it forces learners to lose time solely on decryption of those glamour definitions.
2. Misunderstandings have fueled a whole industry of instructors, teachers, and coaches who make programming seem unnecessarily complex then suggesting the cure.

As a gesture, the book is absolutely free. Unlike those who profit off confusion, I make it available to everyone.
